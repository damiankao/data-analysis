data-analysis
=============

### Description

Some scripts I've used for data analysis. Mostly in Python/Javascript/R

`hierCluster` - Python script to perform hierarchical clustering with scipy and visualize with javascript (D3.js). Here is a demo: http://blog.nextgenetics.net/demo/entry0044/

`SVD` - Python script to perform singular value decomposition and partial reconstruction to smooth data. Here is an image (http://i.imgur.com/uZmVFzT.jpg) with 7 figures. Bottom-most figure is the full reconstruction. Each figure above are partial reconstructions, smoothing the data.
